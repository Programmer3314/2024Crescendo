INTAKE:
-goes up and down off floor 1 motor uses rack and pinion 
-has absolute encoder on intake pinion very little revolutions less than 1 revolution
-another falcon rotates belts to take notes in 
-break beam sensor that detects the note coming through the intake as close as possible to the 
start of the intake opening


SHOOTER:
-After intake note reaches indexer wheels which should stop the note before it reaches the shooter wheels
-2 falcons on indexer will be set to brake mode
-break beam sensor will be put to tell when the note is properly in the indexer
-The shooter itself will be on an absolute encoder rotating about 30 degrees on pivot point
-gear box ratio for shooter adjustment, pinion does 2 turns... TO BE CONTINUED rotor to mechanism ratio needed...
maybe 1:1
-can intake into the shooter at any angle to shooter
-hard stop on the bottom
-debug routine full range of motion test

AMP
-on elevator
-encoder and home
-breake beam to check when note got through so we can score in AMP
-2 falcons
